### Smart Green House Based on GSM 800I Module

This project will initially initialize the hw components RaspberryPi, GSM module, the firebase cloud database, the analog sensors, and Pi camera inputs and outputs.

Next the code will enter a loop to take measurements every 20 sec of the plant condition, through moisture sensor, gas sensor, light sensor, and temperature humidity sensor. Then stores all measurements in a file with the time and date stamp.

Pi must detect any unusual condition of any specified measurements through conditional codes, if humidity or gas wasn't good a fan is to blow air in the mackett. If moisture measurements werenâ€™t good a pump will pump water into the soil, if light wasn't good a certain degree of light is to be powered and increase it in ramp if no progress in the measurements.

GSM module will get certain CMDs from the PI to send messages or make a call. This module can Rx CMDs from a certain mobile number to operate a certain action like turn pump on or fan on or light on as user specify in the MSG with the specified CMDs in the code.

Pi will record the plant on unusual measurements and report the record and all measurements to a firebase database where a mobile application shows the report as a dashboard.

## Installation

First Pi must be attached to pure 5v power supply and GSM module will be given 4.7 rechargeable battery. The pump and the fan will be given a 12v as input to transistor(switch). All the analog sensors must be provided with another 5v power supply.

Secondly put all the circuit into the mackett, moist into the soil, gas near the soil, temp near the soil, also the light sensor must be close to the soil.

Third the pump must be put into the soil connected to a tank and the fan will be put on the mackett edges.

Fourth step the py code must be burned or run on the PI after that the project will operate properly if the PI was permanently provided with WIFI.

    
## Usage/Examples
